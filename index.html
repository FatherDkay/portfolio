          <p>Welcome to my portfolio!  I'm delighted you are here and sincerely hope you find some useful informaiton about me and my journey into software development.  My transition into software development is the result of many different experiences and interests coming together.  Have a look around and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.  Thanks for stopping by!</p>
          <p>I’ve been a working professional for years and have a diverse combination of work experience and education.  I earned a bachelor’s degree in Organizational Leadership which I used working in sales and business management.  I earned a Master of Special Education which served me in my positions as a special education teacher, and director of special education for 2 different schools.  It was my work in education administration that lead me to software development as I began to see the need for a database to better handle the information the various data needs found within a school setting.  After years of working with local database development I decided the time was right for me to investigate transitioning into software development.  I considered several different schools and models, but eventually enrolled at UCLA’s full stack development bootcamp.  This experience has been fast paced and even a bit frustrating, but the results have been amazing.  I’ve been able to quickly add to my skill set while confirming my suspicion that development would be a field I would enjoy.</p>

        <p>Software development - Perhaps a tad obvious, but I've found development is a true passion.  Some people Netflix and chill, I Netflix and code!</p>
        <p>Woodworking - I have a shop in my garage where I work on all sorts of projects</p>
        <p>Music - I enjoy most forms of music and also play drums and piano</p>
